## 🎯 Goals & Design Decisions

- **Modern & clean aesthetic**  
  Neutral tones, warm gold accents, and elegant typography were chosen to reflect a boutique brand identity.

- **Mobile-first approach**  
  The layout was built with responsiveness in mind, ensuring a smooth experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

- **Minimal JavaScript**  
  JavaScript is used only where it improves usability (mobile navigation and form feedback).

- **Scalable structure**  
  CSS variables and reusable components make future updates easy.
